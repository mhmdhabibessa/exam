# Assignment: The Wall
Create a wall page (think Facebook news feed) where users will be able to post messages and see the messages posted by other users.

This app will be integrated with a login app. After successfully logging in or registering, a user should be redirected to localhost:8000/wall, where the wall is displayed. Once you get the messages functionality working, allow users to post comments for any message. Comments should be in a separate database table from messages. Allow the user to delete his/her own messages. Allow users to LIKE messages and comments.

    Objectives:

        • Practice connecting a Django application to a database
        • Integrate the login app with another app
        • Practice one-to-many relationships
        • Practice validating user input and using flash messages
